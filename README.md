Project Description
-------------------

This github directory contains codes, data and reports detailing my
exploratory data analysis and outcome variable prediction for the
[Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand Challenge data
set](!https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data). You will find
my reports in markdown and html formats and my codes written in R.
Reports are in the parent directory while codes are in the
*data\_and\_codes* subdirectory.

The quest with this data set is to predict hourly bike rental count in
the Washington DC area, given historical data comprising of season,
weather, date and time, day type, temperature, humidity and windspeed.
For each hour to be predicted, only historical data prior to the hour of
interest can be used in prediction.

I devised three strategies for tackling this problem. These strategies
are described in detail in the modeling report. In the report, you will
find the pros and cons of each strategy.
